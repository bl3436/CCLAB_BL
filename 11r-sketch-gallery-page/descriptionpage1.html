        <h1 class="title">Bouncing Ball showcases a visual artwork that contains a variety
            of different colored balls that enlarge with a gravitational effect. Hence, allowing
            the user to experience the feeling of watching the balls fall up and down repetitively. This
            artwork contains many unique features such as utilizing an OOP coding style and implementing
            multiple real-life aspects that balls can do such as bouncing, falling due to gravity from
            a certain height, and size enlargement, like a balloon.
